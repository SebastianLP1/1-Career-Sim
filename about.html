  <U><h2>About Me:</h2></U>
  <p2> From a young age i have always had an interest in Military,learning and helping those around me. I started my military caree out of High School at the age of 18 and served for 4 years as a combat medic learning the coplexities of trauma care while also building an interest in coding and programming . First my interest landed me in web development specifically in the realm of webflow and website creation. i quickly realized i did not have the neccessary foundational skills at that time. Therefore i signed up for a class with Fullstack-Academy to further learn and acheive my dream of vecoming a website developer. </p>
